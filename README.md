Assignment 22 on Introduction to Computer Theory:
Externally take the alphabet Σ={a,b} (separated by commas), 
The user also determines what the regular expression will be,
Finally, produce the program code that is capable of generating the language of L words and displays as many words on the screen as the user wants.
Note: Check that the regular expression can be generated from the alphabet!
Note: Bonus will be given to the assignments that can check if the given word belongs to the L language!
Example:
Enter the alphabet Σ={ a,b<ENTER>}
Enter the regular expression: (a+b)*a <ENTER>
How many words of the L language do you want to see? 3 <ENTER>

The regular expression can be generated from the Σ alphabet. Your words are listed.
L={a,aa,ba}
